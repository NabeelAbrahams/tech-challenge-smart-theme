# Tech Challenge: Figma Design Implementation

This repository contains the solution to the tech challenge, which involves recreating a design from Figma using HTML, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS. The main objective of this challenge is to demonstrate your ability to create responsive designs with TailwindCSS and well-structured semantic HTML. Additionally, some functionality is implemented using Vanilla JavaScript.

## Design Details

The design to be recreated can be found in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/K8ebUjtI8Ikh9ZY1BhOY1I/Tech-Challenge?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=gadmH4sD1zCcsJ0g-1).

### Tech Stack

The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:

- HTML
- JavaScript (VanillaJS)
- TailwindCSS

### Features

- The design is fully responsive, supporting both desktop and mobile devices.
- The scrollbar thumb increases to a height of 6px when hovered or touched.
- A "Show More" button (mobile-only) triggers a dropdown revealing additional product cards.
